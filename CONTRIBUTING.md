## Contributing

We expect contributors to abide by our underlying
[code of conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). All conversations and discussions on
GitHub (issues, pull requests) must be respectful and harassment-free.

Remember that communication is key to an open source project. Always be kind.

If you are creating an issue in the repository, please fill out the issue
template to the best of your abilities. The same applies to pull requests. The
templates are in place to provide everyone as much context to work being done.

If you would like to work on an issue, ask to be assigned to it. This avoids
multiple people working on the same issue.
